Game!!

During CS3: Software Development, we spent the first 5 weeks of the course developing a physics engine with is able to handle common physical attributes of body movement such as gravity, elastic and inelastic collisions, and destruction. We then spent the final 5 weeks of the course on a custom game using our implementations.
