Tankz Game!!

CS3: Software Development, we spent the first 5 weeks of the course developing a physics engine with can handle common physical attributes of body movement such as gravity, elastic and inelastic collisions, and destruction. We then spent the final 5 weeks of the course on a custom game using our implementations. 

This project was done in C.

The final result is a 2-player, PvP tank game in which each player is represented by a tank. Both players begin on opposing sides of the landscape that divides them.
The players are then able to take turns either moving, shooting at the landscape and the other player, or collecting power-ups.
